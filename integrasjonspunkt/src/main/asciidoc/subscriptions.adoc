[#subscriptions-create]
== Create a subscription

The service is used to create a webhook a subscription. The webhook is persisted in the database, so
it will continue to work after a reboot.

[NOTE]
Please note, that we do not guarantee delivery of the webhook events.
An event that cannot be delivered, will be retried three times.
If all these attempts fail, the event will not be redelivered.

[TIP]
Only use a small number of webhooks. Usually one webhook should be sufficient.
Creating a webhook for each message is considered bad practise, and can lead to performance degradation.

=== Example 1 - Create a subscription

[source,http,role="primary"]
.Curl
include::{snippets}/subscriptions/create/curl-request.adoc[]

[source,http,role="secondary"]
.Request
include::{snippets}/subscriptions/create/http-request.adoc[]

[source,http,role="secondary"]
.Response
include::{snippets}/subscriptions/create/http-response.adoc[]

Please note that during validation of the input, the
service will attempt to POST a ping message to the URL specified in the "pushEndpoint" attribute. Below is an example
of such a ping message:

[source,http,role="primary"]
.Ping event
include::{snippets}/events/ping/http-request.adoc[]

==== Message Status Filters

Currently the following filters are available:

|===
| Key | Description | Example

| status
| Filter events on message status.
| status=FEIL,LEVETID_UTLOPT

| serviceIdentifier
| Filter events on serviceIdentifier.
| serviceIdentifier=DPO,DPF

| direction
| Filter events on direction.
| direction=INCOMING

|===

All these can be combined using standard HTTP query style.

[role="primary"]
.Example
[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
status=FEIL,LEVETID_UTLOPT&direction=INCOMING&serviceIdentifier=DPO,DPI
